# Recipe Single Page Web Interface

- Keep your JSON backend you created on Exercise 3. Adjust the CORS settings.
- Implement **one** single Razor page, `index.cshtml`.
- Connect to the JSON backend using [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).
- Use Bootstrap 5.0 as a CSS framework.
- Implement all the functionality using [AlpineJs](https://alpinejs.dev/).

Note: This is not a race. Don't take on this exercise until your previous exercises are solidly implemented to the best of your ability.
